# Factorie.z
Factorie.z is an incremental-idle-automation game that is based around the idea of creating and processing different resources to upgrade further buildings and upgrades. This game combines elements of some of my personal favourite games; factorio, satisfactory, mindustry, shapez, etc... 

This game is a passion project of mine.

## Planning
### 0.1 Prototype
The first deliverable, version 0.1, will focus on the base gameplay loop. The main functionality of the foundation gameplay elements will be programming here... This includes;
- World
- Player
- Buildings
  - Hub
  - Furnace
  - Constructor
- Resources
  - Iron
  - Stone
  - Coal
  - Copper
- Currencies
  - Money
### 0.2 Upgrades
This is where the resources and currencies start to matter, with version 0.2, the upgrade phase of development. This phase will first focus on some hud and world generation changes to make it easier for the player to keep track for their upgrades. Three different type of upgrades will be implemented, new buildings, upgraded buildings, and miscellaneous upgrades.
### 0.3+
No current plan.

### 1.0 Final release
The game will have an "ending".
